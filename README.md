SERVERSHIELD

++++++++++++

SERVERSHIELD is a small python script that can be installed into any active web server to monitor
for requests and protect servers against some attack vectors. It can also be used to detect
unauthorised server access and to prevent attacks in the category of DOS attacks.

It has an inbuilt process manager that continuously listens to any process changes and reacts
according to the situation. It could also be used to get maximum performance out of server by
killing all the processes that are not needed by the main service and are consuming processing
power.

SERVERSHIELD comes with a GUI client that enables it to connect to the remote server and get real
time data analytics on processes.
